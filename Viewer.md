- Via the "B" button or the right button you can partially remove the background color.
- You can display the mask via the M key.
- You can change the transformation algorithm via the "T" key.
- Via the "G" key you can display a grid over the image.
- Via the "D" key you can display distortions: surface deformation, angle distortion, or no distortion.
